General Purpose Discord bot for The Boys community Server


Torbek is not a perfect bot. He is actually quite dysfunctional. Expectations of this bot being quite nice, and higher end, will only be met with disappointment. That being said, this is a bot intended for both learning and testing purposes along with challenging the developer on what is able to be done with their little free time & knowledge. If you do turn out to enjoy the bot, please let me know and it'll probably do nothing, except motivate me to add more features.

Things to note:

Torbek is based on a fictional character from the Podcast [Legends of Avantris](https://legendsofavantris.com/) and while the character himself is not an original idea of the developer, the developer just so happens to enjoy him so much he wishes to bring him to life in a small friend Discord server. All credits for the work and creation of the character solely go to [Legends of Avantris](https://legendsofavantris.com/). All development and ideas of the developer are pertinent to the developer, but he strongly encourages anyone to check out the Legends of Avantris podcasts.

Torbek has abandonment issues. They will also have this feature in the bot later in the future. Like Tomadachies though, Torbek will also likely be forgotten and only remembered years after he has dried into but a lonely husk of a bug bear. 

Torbek is apart of a DnD series and as such will probably incorporate parts of the podcast, plus parts of DnD into his character and his ecosystem. If you don't like DnD then deal with it. Maybe get some more hobbies. Or don't add Torbek. 

I'll add more stuff later on in the future if I remember, don't expect too much.
